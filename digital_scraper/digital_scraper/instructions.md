## Instructions for use
This python code uses the python library scrapy, docs are here - https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/  

To run the scraping algorithm, navigate to ../digital_scraper and run the following command. This will save the data to the csv 'csv_name.csv'.  

scrapy crawl digital_scraper -o csv_name.csv -t csv  

To change the algorithm the two files you will 'need' to change are digital.py and items.py. The code has certain bits commented out simply because I wanted to use them later. There is probably a massive bunch of functionality that I haven't used yet, but this does what I needed it to do. Perhaps it could also be more efficient.
